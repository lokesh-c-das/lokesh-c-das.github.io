I am an ***Assistant Professor*** in the [School of Computing](https://www.wichita.edu/academics/engineering/SoC/) at Wichita State University, where I direct [The AIMS (Artificial Intelligence, Mobility, and Safety) Research Lab](https://lokesh-c-das.github.io/aimslab/). I earned my ***PhD in Computer Science*** from the University of Memphis, under the guidance of [Dr. Myounggyu Won](https://www.memphis.edu/cs/people/faculty_pages/myounggyu-won.php). Prior to that, I completed my MS in Computer Science at the University of Memphis in 2022 and obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh. 

Before pursuing my PhD, I worked as a software engineer at [Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh](https://research.samsung.com/srbd) and served as a Senior Officer in the Information and Communication Technology Division at Agrani Bank PLC. My research interests encompass Intelligent Transportation Systems, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, V2X Communication, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Speech Emotion Recognition, Cybersecurity, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
